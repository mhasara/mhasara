## 💡 Tip — make the streak more visible (optional)
If you want a textual badge for your current streak (nice in a header), you can add a small custom badge using a GitHub Action that updates a repo badge file. If you'd like, I can:
- provide a ready-to-use GitHub Action that updates a `streak-badge.svg` daily, or
- fetch your current language percentages and render neat progress bars in the README.
